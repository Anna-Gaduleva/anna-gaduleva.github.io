                    <!-- Taken from https://www.enotes.com/topics/freakonomics -->
                    <p>Journalist Steven Levitt and economist Stephen Dubner have an innovative approach
                        to economics. Citing studies by a wide variety of researchers, they argue that standardized
                        tests give teachers incentive to cheat, that the KKK isn't really as powerful as it says it is,
                        and that there's a direct correlation between legalized abortion and lower crime rates.

                        Levitt and Dubner make surprising connections between sumo-wrestlers and teachers, the KKK and
                        real estate agents, and other unexpected pairings to show how economists can use statistics to
                        explain interesting social phenomena. Perhaps the most culturally relevant point Levitt and Dubner
                        make in the book is that the decreasing crime rates of the 1990s can be traced back to Roe v. Wade,
                        the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion. Fewer unwanted children leads to fewer criminals.
                        Levitt and Dubner spend two chapters focusing on socioeconomic issues involving class, race, and biology.
                        Using years of education statistics, they conclude that students who are driven to succeed will do
                        so regardless of the school they attend.</p>

                    <p>In Part I of The Elegant Universe, “The Edge of Knowledge,” Greene introduces the central problem
                        of modern physics: the incompatibility of Einstein’s theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics.
                        He then lists the physical curiosities—properties of the motion of light, gravity, and the behavior of particles
                        at the subatomic level—that have prevented physicists from establishing a single coherent theory for how the
                        universe works. For most of the twentieth century, physicists contented themselves with describing either the most
                        small-scale or the most large-scale workings of the cosmos, but never both simultaneously. At the end of this
                        section, Greene describes both the objectives and the promise of superstring theory, which attempts to merge the
                        laws of general relativity with those of quantum mechanics.</p>

                    <p>Our brains are comprised of two characters, one that thinks fast, System 1, and one that
                        thinks slow, System 2. System 1 operates automatically, intuitively, involuntary, and
                        effortlessly—like when we drive, read an angry facial expression, or recall our age.
                        System 2 requires slowing down, deliberating, solving problems, reasoning, computing,
                        focusing, concentrating, considering other data, and not jumping to quick conclusions—
                        like when we calculate a math problem, choose where to invest money, or fill out a
                        complicated form. These two systems often conflict with one another. System 1 operates
                        on heuristics that may not be accurate. System 2 requires effort evaluating those
                        heuristics and is prone error. The plot of his book is how to, “recognize situations in
                        which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when stakes are
                        high,” (page 28)</p>

                    <p>Extinction seems to be a natural part of the life cycle. During its history, there have been five major extinction
                        episodes on Earth: the Ordovician, Devonian, Permian, Triassic and Cretaceous. In addition, there have been many
                        other smaller ones. During the Permian period, at least 95 percent of all the animals known from the fossil record
                        died out. On average, a species exists for about four million years, which is approximately how long humans have been around.
                        For most cases, scientists have little idea what killed off species. Prime contributors include changes in global
                        climate, changing sea levels, oxygen depletion of the seas, meteor and comet impacts, huge hurricanes, volcanoes and
                        catastrophic solar flares. There is just too little evidence to determine the exact causes for mass extinctions.</p>

                    <p>Tony Dungy changed the game of American football with a counterintuitive coaching approach: instead of trying to outmatch his
                        opponents with thicker playbooks and complex schemes, Tony drilled his team on only a few key plays. He did everything he could
                        to get his team to stop thinking, and react based on habit instead.Tony knew that habits can’t usually be overcome; instead, a habit
                        can only be changed if a new routine is successfully inserted into the process with the same cue and the same reward. He trained his
                        team to automatically link the cues they already knew to different on-field routines – ones that involved less complexity, fewer choices,
                        and more subconscious reactions. In succession, with this approach Tony turned two abysmal teams into championship contenders.</p>
